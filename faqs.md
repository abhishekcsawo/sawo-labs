# FAQS

### Can I become who I want to be?

That's a tough question but thankfully, our team is on it. Please bear with us while we're investigating.

### What should the 'hostname' in my Project?

If you are doing a local setup, use 'localhost', and if that doesn't work '127.0.0.1' should do the trick.

### **I am getting  'Something went wrong, Please Contact Admin' error, What should i do?**

This means your API key or hostname is incorrect. Verify the API key for your project, and follow the previous thread if it's a local setup.
